            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
              <li class="list-item">1¼ cups milk</li>
              <li class="list-item">
                2¼ teaspoons (one package) active dry yeast
              </li>
              <li class="list-item">2 eggs</li>
              <li class="list-item">1 egg</li>
              <li class="list-item">
                8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, melted and cooled
              </li>
              <li class="list-item">¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
              <li class="list-item">1 teaspoon salt</li>
              <li class="list-item">
                4¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out the dough
              </li>
              <li class="list-item">
                2 quarts neutral oil, for frying, plus more for the bowl.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="instructions-container">
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
              <li class="ol-list-item">
                Heat the milk until it is warm but not hot, about 90 degrees. In
                a large bowl, combine it with the yeast. Stir lightly, and let
                sit until the mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.
              </li>
              <li class="ol-list-item">
                Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a dough
                hook, beat the eggs, butter, sugar and salt into the yeast
                mixture. Add half of the flour (2 cups plus 2 tablespoons), and
                mix until combined, then mix in the rest of the flour until the
                dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Add more flour,
                about 2 tablespoons at a time, if the dough is too wet. If
                you’re using an electric mixer, the dough will probably become
                too thick to beat; when it does, transfer it to a floured
                surface, and gently knead it until smooth. Grease a large bowl
                with a little oil. Transfer the dough to the bowl, and cover.
                Let rise at room temperature until it doubles in size, about 1
                hour.
              </li>
              <li class="ol-list-item">
                Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface, and roll it to
                ½-inch thickness. Cut out the doughnuts with a doughnut cutter,
                concentric cookie cutters or a drinking glass and a shot glass
                (the larger one should be about 3 inches in diameter), flouring
                the cutters as you go. Reserve the doughnut holes. If you’re
                making filled doughnuts, don’t cut out the middle. Knead any
                scraps together, being careful not to overwork, and let rest for
                a few minutes before repeating the process.
              </li>
              <li class="ol-list-item">
                Put the doughnuts on two floured baking sheets so that there is
                plenty of room between each one. Cover with a kitchen towel, and
                let rise in a warm place until they are slightly puffed up and
                delicate, about 45 minutes. If your kitchen isn’t warm, heat the
                oven to 200 at the beginning of this step, then turn off the
                heat, put the baking sheets in the oven and leave the door ajar.
              </li>
              <li class="ol-list-item">
                About 15 minutes before the doughnuts are done rising, put the
                oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, and
                heat it to 375. Meanwhile, line cooling racks, baking sheets or
                plates with paper towels.
              </li>
              <li class="ol-list-item">
                Roll out the dough into a thin sheet and cut out round disc
                shapes for empanadas (use round molds or a small plate). You can
                also make small individual balls with the dough and roll out
                each individual ball to a round shape (doesn’t need to be
                perfectly round) – if you have a tortilla press you can use it
                to flatten the dough balls.
              </li>
              <li class="ol-list-item">
                Carefully add the doughnuts to the oil, a few at a time. If
                they’re too delicate to pick up with your fingers (they may be
                this way only if you rose them in the oven), use a metal spatula
                to pick them up and slide them into the oil. It’s O.K. if they
                deflate a bit; they’ll puff back up as they fry. When the
                bottoms are deep golden, after 45 seconds to a minute, use a
                slotted spoon to flip; cook until they’re deep golden all over.
                Doughnut holes cook faster. Transfer the doughnuts to the
                prepared plates or racks, and repeat with the rest of the dough,
                adjusting the heat as needed to keep the oil at 375. Glaze or
                fill as follows, and serve as soon as possible.
